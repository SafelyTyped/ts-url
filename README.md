# Welcome To @safelytyped/url!

## Introduction

This is the README for `@safelytyped/url`. Rather than put all the docs in one, impossible-to-navigate file, this README is here to point you at where you can find all the documentation we've written.

## Quick Start

```
# run this from your Terminal
npm install @safelytyped/url
```

```typescript
// add this import to your Typescript code
import { URL } from "@safelytyped/url"
```

__VS Code users:__ once you've added a single import anywhere in your project, you'll then be able to auto-import anything else that this library exports.

## Documentation

Looking for more detailed documentation? You'll find it under the [docs](./docs) folder.
